# COVID-19 Predictor Web Application

Welcome to the COVID-19 Predictor Web Application! This project utilizes a deep learning model to predict whether an input chest X-ray image shows signs of COVID-19, Normal, or Pneumonia. The model has achieved an accuracy of 90%, making it reliable for practical use.

## Features

- Prediction: Upload a chest X-ray image and get instant predictions for COVID-19, Normal, or Pneumonia.
- User-friendly Interface: The web application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.
- High Accuracy: The underlying deep learning model has been trained with a dataset and achieves an accuracy of 90% on average.

## Technologies Used

- Flask Framework: Used for building the web application.
- Python: Programming language used for model training and web development.
- Deep Learning: The model is built using deep learning techniques.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend design and styling.
- JavaScript: For enhancing user interaction and handling image uploads.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/owais-mazhar/covid19-predictor.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
